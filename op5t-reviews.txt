A full metal body is just dull in my opinion. Physical build of this phone is very good.When it comes to software, Oxygen OS kicks ass. I won't do the fanboy pitch but I did love a couple of things.1. Quick Settings tile to toggle data between 2 SIMs.  (this is just brilliant) I don't know if any other phone offers this.2. Reading mode. I do a lot of reading so this is just great to have.3. Single tap data toggle is back again. I used to root my phones just so I could do this.4. In almost 4 months of use, I barely saw the phone stutter and I have 129 apps installed.5. I saved the best for the last, Dash Charging. Wireless charging is fancy but it charges very slow. I'm glad OnePlus decided to include a Dash Charger rather than making consumers buy an additional accessory.Can't say much about the camera as I'm not a photography nut but it does take good pictures in well lit places.My only hope is that this phone gets Android P.
