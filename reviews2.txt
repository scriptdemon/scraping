After reading many reviews and feedback from friends ordered this model with high expectation, this is my  first android mobile and first time  switching from Nokia. With lot of expectation started setting up my mobile, surprised to note that my home WiFi SSID not detected by this device, but it able to detect and  show many other Neighbour ssid and my ssid is successfully connected to many other devices at home(windows mobile, android mobile, iPad, laptop, kindle, Sony TV) for many months  . So I need  not doubt my router capabilities.  Then manually added my SSlD to this device but no luck. Then by enabling  hot spot from my windows mobile, did basic settings to register my google account and installed few apps. Please note all these steps were done without putting any sim in the device, I suppose with my limited knowledge on communication technology, to detect  wifi router by this device SIM is not required. Iam yet to check with SIM. Obviously I  suspected on either then wifi detecting hardware in device or the android software settings.  Did few search about android issue for wifi detection, found no clue so far. Then tired with my router admin login to connect via WPS option( never tried before for any other device so not sure am tried my best to use this feature), after successful handshake through PIN the device could not connect to the router. Verified wifi security options(WPA/PSA2) to confirm the supported options in the device. These are few troubleshooting done from.my side, but  I have not done full research in the web due to lack of time and other commitments. Any other suggestions from reviewers and other users of this device shall greatly help me to try my best before I click the return option for this device. I have time till Oct 2 to return this device as per info in my amazon account.Update: After some more tweak and experiments, able to connect to my WiFi router at home. Have to change security settings to WEP in the device  saved network profile. Device still could it automatically detect and shoe my ssid.

After reading many reviews and feedback from friends ordered this model with high expectation, this is my  first android mobile and first time  switching from Nokia. With lot of expectation started setting up my mobile, surprised to note that my home WiFi SSID not detected by this device, but it able to detect and  show many other Neighbour ssid and my ssid is successfully connected to many other devices at home(windows mobile, android mobile, iPad, laptop, kindle, Sony TV) for many months  . So I need  not doubt my router capabilities.  Then manually added my SSlD to this device but no luck. Then by enabling  hot spot from my windows mobile, did basic settings to register my google account and installed few apps. Please note all these steps were done without putting any sim in the device, I suppose with my limited knowledge on communication technology, to detect  wifi router by this device SIM is not required. Iam yet to check with SIM. Obviously I  suspected on either then wifi detecting hardware in device or the android software settings.  Did few search about android issue for wifi detection, found no clue so far. Then tired with my router admin login to connect via WPS option( never tried before for any other device so not sure am tried my best to use this feature), after successful handshake through PIN the device could not connect to the router. Verified wifi security options(WPA/PSA2) to confirm the supported options in the device. These are few troubleshooting done from.my side, but  I have not done full research in the web due to lack of time and other commitments. Any other suggestions from reviewers and other users of this device shall greatly help me to try my best before I click the return option for this device. I have time till Oct 2 to return this device as per info in my amazon account.Update: After some more tweak and experiments, able to connect to my WiFi router at home. Have to change security settings to WEP in the device  saved network profile. Device still could it automatically detect and shoe my ssid.
