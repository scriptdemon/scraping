It would be a perfect choice if you want a phone within 13000/- budget with all basic features like nice dual camera which can capture wonderful macro images, perfect selfie camera, fast multi tasking etc. This phone does not have hitting issue, does not have hanging issue etc. I am not a high gamer, I am a normal user who uses internet 24 hours, watches YouTube, Amazon Prime Videos, Hotstar in most of the times, uses social networking sites, takes pictures, is listening to songs, calls frequently etc and for me it's an amazing purchase. This does not come with Gorilla Glass & it comes with a screen protector which is already installed and it is not at all an easy job to uninstall it & install another screen protector of your choice.. low light camera / picture quality is bad & network connectivity is also a bit weak... but overall, till now, I am very happy with this phone and would highly recommend it...", "overall": "4.0", "summary": "Wow!", "reviewTime": "18 September 2017", "helpful": [6, 6]}, {"reviewerID": "R3UAC3MOW1XPQE", "reviewText": "Best buy 9000 rs with offer from Amazon, with in one day delivery so good.

Display: 4.5/5*2. Design: 4/5*3. Camera: 4.5/5*4. Battery backup: 4/5*5. Performance: 4/5*6. Software & Updates: 4/5*---------------------------------------Cons:-1. I think the biggest drawback of this phone is the sound output and its quality. The sound output and its quality via the main loud speaker is just average (if the volume is set below 60%), also at higher volume the quality gets very poor. The sound output quality via headphones is good but again the max volume is quite low (It's like 70% of Redmi 4/5A)2. Display backlight flickering issue on brightness changing (I think it's related to software and can easily be fixed with an ota update)3. 4G can be used in any of the sim slots but the problem is that only one sim slot supports 4G while the other one supports only 2G-------------Others:-1. Charging time: It takes less than 3 hours to fully charge the phone using supplied 2Amp/5V charger2. Battery backup: Easily lasts 2 days with normal usage with 5-6 hrs of screen on time (SOT)", "overall": "4.0", "summary": "Overall a very good smartphone", "reviewTime": "12 February 2018", "helpful": [4, 4]}, {"reviewerID": "R2MB0RGMG1R5F5", "reviewText": "My review is only of the camera as I haven't really tested the performance in other areas.

I would recon it as one of the best Value for Money mobiles in this price segment!Initially I was hesitant to buy a mobile from the Huawei's sub company Honor since it wasn't much known in India. But within a day of usage that thought was changed! Huawei's own Kirin chipset is a fabulous one maintaining power performance and energy at unbelievable rate. The battery lasts for a solid day for heavy usage(playing a movie, playing atleast 800MB sized game, etc)Spotlight goes to the dual camera setup which is the first known in this segment price range mobiles! I'm not at all disappointed with its outdoor condition lighting and slips in artificial lights(it can be rectified in Pro Photo mode if u could fit the adjustments) The only lack in camera is the video stabilization...could have been better than given.Cons have to be absence of NFC and the second sim being only 2G support. Other than that it is a stylish,killer mobile!(And I'm also became a fan of EMUI now which I was not before)", "overall": "5.0", "summary": "Honor 6x after 7 months usage...", "reviewTime": "15 October 2017", "helpful": [4, 4]}, {"reviewerID": "R176HM0SXT5J8K", "reviewText": "I have used the phone for about a month and I would say it's splendid!I purchased this phone on the MAY 2017.I bought is for Rs. 13000-/I am writing this review after 9 months of usageTill now I have not found any fault in the phoneThe phone is working super duper smoothIt is receiving updates at regular intervals.PROS:->Camera (Best in class for the price, hands down)->Day to day performance is top notch and absolutely no heating. Kirin 655 rocks.-> Battery life is decent 1 and half days on a single charge and normal usage. Phone charges in about 2hrs 15 minutes.->All sensors are present and pedometer is a bonus.->EMUI 5 is feature rich, elegant and snappy.->The screen has nice viewing angles and the colours are pretty accurate.
