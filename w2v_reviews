Isn't that a mouthful for a product description?  I'd have thought Canon HTC-100 would be enough.  I'm compelled to say this because if you search Amazon for \"Canon HTC-100\", you'll find 1.5-, 2-, 3-, even 4-meter cables, supporting HDMI 1.3, 1.4, you name it -- often from the same manufacturer.  There's even a genuine Canon HTC-100 for sale -- except half the reviewers warn they didn't receive a genuine Canon cable.  Amazon needs to take some responsibility for creating major confusion over generic replacement products like this sold by a third party and fulfilled by Amazon.  And Canon shares some blame too since Canon Direct doesn't list any specification for an HTC-100 -- for all I know they get them from Amazon.Here's what I know:  I paid $8.25 for my HDMI cable.  It came in a labelled, OEM-style plastic bag with a UPC code of 9983891204.  It works perfectly, connecting my Canon 7D camera to my Samsung HDTV.  The connectors are gold-plated.  The cable itself is of reasonable quality and will probably outlive my camera and my TV.  There are reusable protective plastic caps on the connectors (you are responsible for not losing them).  Given that Canon Direct wanted more than 8 times the price I paid for their version of this cable (after a 15% discount at that), I'm rather pleased with my purchase. I am not so pleased with the confusion that Amazon and Canon have created here -- consumer brand loyalty is a real thing; manufacturers and retailers mess with it at their peril.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A fine product but a poor buying experience", "unixReviewTime": 1364083200, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2013"}, {"reviewerID": "A39JL3OBJIBIX7", "asin": "9983891204", "reviewerName": "Don L.

Wall", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I bought this item because I purchased my HTC HD2 with T-Mobile USA on eBay, and the seller did not include the AC Adapter for charging, and I inadvertently damaged my USB communication/charging cable while traveling this past summer.I thought that this Micro-USB power kit would be an excellent substitute for both, seeing as how it allows charging by wall outlet, car \"cigarette lighter,\" or any USB-enabled device.And, in the most basic fashion, it does.  I tried it in all three set-ups, and it technically does charge and function any way you use it.  However, having previously owned the HTC-included USB cable for my phone, I can tell you that this device's charge time is not up to snuff.  While charging by USB is normally slow, this device is extremely so.  I used to take 2->3 hours to charge my phone when plugged into a computer or video game console, but even when plugged into the wall, this device easily took over 8.It feels light and weak, as though it is made of cheap components, and it behaves as such, as well.I even tried using a different USB-to-Micro-USB cable plugged into the AC Adapter to see if it was only the cable that ships with this power kit, but the results were not palpably different.I broke down and bought a new Micro-USB comm/charging cable from T-Mobile within a few weeks, but my money and time had already been wasted.In summation: this device is probably made cheaply, because it does not seem durable, and charges so slowly, you won't even be able to use it, unless the only circumstances under which you need it are over-night charging at the end of the day.

The accessories were not used -- they would not fit the unit.  If I had asked for money back, I could understand the deduction, but I just wanted the correct accessories for the unit.  Those who sold me the Garmin who tried to rectify the situation tried to help; however, they didn't know what the correct accessories were either.My recommendation to you is watch what is recommended for accessories; the people who will try to help you correct the problem are nice people who are genuinely trying to straighten out the problem.

After buying this cable and dealing with MANY phone calls to techs at both companies (I spoke to 6 different people between the two), I finally ended up being told that there is NO WAY to transfer TEXTS from that model of phone. Data such as contact lists can be transferred with this cable or via Bluetooth (if your computer is Bluetooth capable), but not texts.At first everyone told me the cable must be defective when the transfer could not be accomplished. When I contacted the seller (Trent, at A Days Tech) he was great. Though the Amazon policy did not require it, he was willing to give me a refund if the cable was faulty. When I finally spoke to a tech who was more knowledgable than all the others, he informed me that texts are not within the realm of the type of data that can be transferred from this phone (nor from most phones, for that matter) to a computer. Since the first T-Mobile tech I spoke to gave me misinformation about this cable that I never needed in the first place, I got T-Mobile to refund the cost of the cable & shipping to me. (I probably should have had Nokia split the cost with them since their reps were just as bad, but I only have so much time to listen to \"hold music\".)Moral of the story: Not all customer service reps and \"technicians\" are as knowledgeable as they should be -- and you should insist upon a refund when their misinformation costs you money and time!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Seller gets 5 stars / Cable is good as a charger, but NOT for transfer of TEXTS from this cell phone.", "unixReviewTime": 1334880000, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2012"}]},

I certainly did not (and did try to research this assumption) but they are.I previously used a micro-USB cable for my Sprint MiFi card for three years, but it was a single USB to multi-tip cables. I have noticed that some later models (one female full-size USB cable connecting to many tips) have a twist-lock cable to offer some security from losing a tip, but alas mine did not. After many years of happily charging and using my SPRINT MiFi card from computer and iPod charger, I lost the micro-USB tip.Thus began a search for a replacement. I ordered this cable and another from another supplier -- both specified that they worked for the Verizon Novatel MiFi 2200. Neither works for the SPRINT MiFi Novatel 2200!If you are looking for a USB to micro-USB cable for your Sprint MiFi Novatel 2200 card, try a micro-USB BlackBerry charger. I was moving a friend's car and noticed a charger plugged into his dashboard. It had the micro-USB tip on it. I plugged it into my card, and voila! - It worked! I looked closely at the cable and saw \"BlackBerry\" embossed on it. I have since ordered an inexpensive BlackBerry cable for my Novatel 2200 card. Will update this review with a link, providing that it works.BTW - How do you tell when the cable is working or not: Working-the light on the top of the card is amber or green and the card remains a reasonable (warm NOT hot) temperature. NOT working-the light on the top of the card stays red and the card gets very hot; or when you plug the card into your computer, it shows the red light on the top and your Windoze operating system attempts to access the data part of your MiFi card.KD", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "DOES NOT WORK for Sprint MiFi Novatel 2200", "unixReviewTime": 1323907200, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2011"}, {"reviewerID": "A3TKTXL4OOI26X", "asin": "9985622650", "reviewerName": "Paul A Tower", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This fit and worked fine.
