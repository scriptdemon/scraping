The main Dual camera is pretty good.5. Dual sim slot, one is hybrid( you can use it for external memory card).6. face unlock and twin app is added.Cons:1. sometimes it may lag sometimes ( if you get the Chinese version).2. It doesn't have the latest Android it runs on 7.0 Nougat also EMUI version is not the latest one its 5.1Note: There are two versions of this phone one is Made in India and another is Made in China ( I had received china version which was faulty but they replaced it and I received made in India version, it's working superfine fine.)", "overall": "5.0", "summary": "Best smartphone for 13k", "reviewTime": "5 April 2018", "helpful": [8, 8]}, {"reviewerID": "R1S6B01XA9VN8Y", "reviewText": "Honor 7x is good..mobile slim10/10F Cam 9/10R Cam 10/10Display 10/10Battery 10/10Features 10/10Charging 2 v 5 amps goodBattery backup 10/10Face unlock rolled over but new purchasers have to wait till their turn comes.13000 full HD PLUS REALLY WORTH MOBILEBUILT QWALILY SUPERBFULL SCREEN DISPLAY NICEANDROID 7 AT PRESENT..

After a week of use below is my review.Pros :1) Premium Styling.2) Great grip to hold. Camera placing looks amazing.3) Great viewing colors of display.4) 5.92 Inch 18:9 Screen is awsome.5) Battery is enough to last for a day with Mix use of Daily tasks, Music, Gaming and Data. Heavy gamers may feel otherwise.6) Camera Setup is top notch in this budget. Portrait mode, Bokeh and other modes. Good colors.7) Good CPU and GPU performance but cud have been better a little.8) For sibgle SIM users there is hybrid SIM slot with memory card option, but Dual SIM users can be disappointed. (I haven't seen many phones with SIM card + Dual SIM option, though there are specific models available)9) Good customisation option but I would rather go with full customisation like Asus or go Pure Android like OnePlus not inbetween.Cons:1) Still on Android 7, but company has released Oreo Beta rom so hopefully that will becom a another plus for 7x2) We are in 2018 and still Companies go for MicroUSB and Not Type - C Port is really killing the products to be on top of the list.3) Bigger the battery, Fasther the Charging should be. Can not wait 4 hours to get phone fully charged. Fast Charging is a necessity where technology is getting wireless and AI is the new hieght to be achieved.4) Touch sensor is little out of league compared to other Brands. Sometimes have to touch multiple times in the center of the screen for a task. Can be tweaked in OTA Udates.5) I really miss the notification Slider from OnePlus. Makes your life so easy. Many wont mind it.6) Front Facing Camera is 60% of its capacity can have some OTA of that too.7) RAM management can be better. Again ASUS and OnePlus has done better in this department.I am hoping that with Oreo Update 7x will be Almost a perfect phone from Software point of view with all the small problems tweaked and will better the performance.Overall Perfect Budget phone for none technical and moderate users who likes a good stylish phone with above aerage performance.", "overall": "4.0", "summary": "2) Great grip to hold", "reviewTime": "7 April 2018", "helpful": [3, 3]}, {"reviewerID": "RCXZE6W0HW1BV", "reviewText": "Quick review of the phone let's go directly to cons because everyone knows pros.Battery drains very very fast.WiFi turns ON/Off  very frequently automaticallyTakes lot of time to get fully charged battery (2.5 hours)", "overall": "2.0", "summary": "Battery drains very fast", "reviewTime": "3 February 2018", "helpful": [1, 1]}, {"reviewerID": "R21SPNAIK91OKX", "reviewText": "Touch is not working properly with Tempered glass..3 Type of tempered glass has been used in this 3 days of usage...Thinking to return and refund the money ....", "overall": "1.0", "summary": "Touch Issue", "reviewTime": "14 March 2018", "helpful": [7, 7]}, {"reviewerID": "R1A0KX5U86V121", "reviewText": "This is honest review after usage of 3 months ....I am regular buyer of this make earlier i was having Honor 4x, then honor 6x now this one....in the starting the phone is fine and camera quality is good....but performance lacks....lot of issues like restarting automatically and unable to open whatsapp or other application...suddenly screen freezing and feeling like 2 gb ram mobile and O/s is not working fine with mobile....HONOR is losing its honor....Expecting support from Service team of honor ...Else this will be my last phone from Huawei honor and i will stop all my friends from buying this make....", "overall": "2.0", "summary": "HONOR has to save its name by improving quality ...else it will lose its goodwill.", "reviewTime": "7 April 2018", "helpful": [8, 8]}, {"reviewerID": "R2B3TKUA02UYXA", "reviewText": "Huawei have always made some good phones and this honor 7x is definitely a clear beast at this price.
